# DEPRECATED REPOSITORY

As of Firefox for Android 44, a custom addon is no longer required to
customize Firefox Accounts and Firefox Sync server URLs.

The documentation at
https://docs.services.mozilla.com/howtos/run-sync-1.5.html and
https://docs.services.mozilla.com/howtos/run-fxa.html has been updated
and is now the canonical documentation for configuring custom servers
in Firefox for Android.

The contents of this repository have been maintained in `deprecated`
for interested parties to inspect.
